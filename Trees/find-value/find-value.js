/*
This question is asked by Google. Given the reference to the root of a binary search tree and a search value, return the reference to the node that contains the value if it exists and null otherwise.
Note: all values in the binary search tree will be unique.

OICE
Output: a tree node
Input: the root of a tree
Constraints: n/a
Edge Cases: if tree is null return null


HL: compare the node value to the value we're looking for => recurse: call func or left child, call function on right right child
