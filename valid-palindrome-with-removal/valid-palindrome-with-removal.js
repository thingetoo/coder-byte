/*
This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string and the ability to delete at most one character, return whether or not it can form a palindrome.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Ex: Given the following strings...

"abcba", return true
"foobof", return true (remove the first 'o', the second 'o', or 'b')
"abccab", return false

OICE

Output: a boolean => represent whether is a palindrome with a removal
Input: a string
Contraints: logn
Edge Cases: empty string => true, type must be string
