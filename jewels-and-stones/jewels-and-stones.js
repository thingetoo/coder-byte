// This question is asked by Amazon. Given a string representing your stones and another string representing a list of jewels, return the number of stones that you have that are also jewels.

// Ex: Given the following jewels and stones...

// jewels = "abc", stones = "ac", return 2
// jewels = "Af", stones = "AaaddfFf", return 3
// jewels = "AYOPD", stones = "ayopd", return 0

// OICE
// Output: a number representing the stones that are also jewels
// Input: two strings representing the jewels and stones
// Constraints: O(n) or less
// Edge Cases: n/a

// declare a result variable which will keep track of the # of stones that are also jewels
// initialize a hash => will contain the jewels eventually

// iterate over the jewels
//   store them in a hash table: if not seen store them, => quantity doesn't matter


// iterate over the stones
//   check if each stone is present in the jewels hash
//     increment result

// return the result

const jewelsAndStones = (jewels, stones) => {
