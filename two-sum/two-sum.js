/*
This question is asked by Google. Given an array of integers, return whether or not two numbers sum to a given target, k.
Note: you may not sum a number with itself.

Ex: Given the following...

[1, 3, 8, 2], k = 10, return true (8 + 2)
[3, 9, 13, 7], k = 8, return false
[4, 2, 6, 5, 2], k = 4, return true (2 + 2)

OICE method:

Output: a boolean that represents whether or not two numbers sum to the target
Input: an array of numbers
Constraints: less than O(n) time
Edge Cases: if the array length is equal to one, return false,
