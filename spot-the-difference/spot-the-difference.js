This question is asked by Google.

You are given two strings, s and t which only consist of lowercase letters. t is generated by shuffling the letters in s as well as potentially adding an additional random character. Return the letter that was randomly added to t if it exists, otherwise, return ’ ‘.

Note: You may assume that at most one additional character can be added to t.

OICE

Output: a string representing the letter that was added or an empty space
Input: two strings
Constraints: n/a
Edge Cases: no letters added => empty string

=> check if the length of the two strings are the same

=> Two potential ways:
1. We could sort the strings and then iterate through to see if they match

2. We could store the string values in a hash table and see if they match by subtracting values from the hash
